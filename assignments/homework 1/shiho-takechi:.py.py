report = """
Approach:
This analysis focused on irregular text data collected from eBay listings. First, regular expressions were used 
to extract structured information such as prices and seller ratings. Then, an NLP pipeline (tokenization, stopword 
removal, and lemmatization) was applied to identify key terms in the text. The precision was improved by adding 
custom stopwords specific to this dataset.

Challenges:
The main challenge was the unstructured nature of the text, which contained a lot of noise. As a result, 
the standard stopword list was insufficient and required customization to fit the dataset. Also, I should have excluded 
some words on the top 15th list such as possitive and watchers because it is the words always appeared in every 
searching results and I should have to deal with some words represents "countries" which were not important word when 
it was counted as a separate meaning (eg. state, south)

Findings:
The analysis successfully extracted specific business-related data, such as prices and ratings. NLP results revealed 
that the main topic of the listings centered on ‚ÄúLalka dolls‚Äù associated with ‚ÄúKalinowski‚Äôs novel.‚Äù This demonstrates 
that, with appropriate preprocessing, valuable insights can be derived even from irregular and noisy data which are 
mixedn information about the novel"Lalka" and doll" lalka".
